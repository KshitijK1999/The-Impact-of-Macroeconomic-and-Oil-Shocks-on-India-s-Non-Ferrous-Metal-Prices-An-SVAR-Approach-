# The-Impact-of-Macroeconomic-and-Oil-Shocks-on-India-s-Non-Ferrous-Metal-Prices-An-SVAR-Approach-
India has continuously been increasing integration into the global economy and is on its way to take the spotlight as the world's fastest-growing economy. The key growth factors in this development include creating opportunities for growth for all industries, especially the metals industry. This paper compares the value shocks from the real interest rates, real exchange rates, and other key macroeconomic variables on the metal prices. The structural VAR models are estimated on monthly data over the period 2005m12â€“2019m12 to determine the asymmetric effect of the macroeconomic shocks and determine whether commodity prices display overshooting behavior in response to these shocks. The impulse response and the forecast error variance decomposition function are used to analyze the long-term and short-term impacts on the Indian non-ferrous metal prices. The results indicate that the interest rate and crude oil shocks have a significant positive impact on the prices of metals, while the exchange rate negatively affects India's metal prices. Metal prices tend to display an overshooting behaviour in response to changes in exchange rate and the metals index. Besides, the forecast error variance decomposition reveals the incremental contribution of crude oil prices in ensuring the stability of metal prices.
